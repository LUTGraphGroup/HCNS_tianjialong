# HCNS:A Deep Learning Model for Identifying Essential Proteins Based on Hypergraph Convolution and Sequence Features
The HCNS model, which integrates the Hypergraph Convolutional Network (HGCN) module, the Seq-CNN-MB-NAG feature extraction module, and the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) recognition module, significantly enhancing the accuracy of essential protein identification.Experimental results show that the HCNS model outperforms existing methods, achieving an accuracy of ***93.38\%***, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ***98.33\%*** and an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR) of ***97.16\%***, demonstrating its potential in essential protein identification.
